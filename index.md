### **Section B19: From Data to Dispatch - Optimizing SDG&E Field Services**
### **Mentors: Phi Nguyen, Chuck Hahm, and Fatemeh Aarabi**

*Questions:* 

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic that we have covered this quarter has been understanding the current systems of storing information about different types of maintenance tasks and how they are assigned which we covered during our EDA investigations of the data. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For Quarter 2 I would like to understand more about the current dispatch system so that I can more effectively identify the gaps and areas that need to be optimized the most. 

**3. What is a potential chaneg you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

If I could do one thing differently, I think it would be to understand a bit more of the real-life applications of the work that we are doing in this capstone. Focusing more on the bigger picture would have made it a lot easier to know what specific aspects of the data to investigate during our EDA.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

We have just started learning more about Linear Programming and other methods of optimizing scheduling systems and I am eager to learn more about this both in theory and practice.
